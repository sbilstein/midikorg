# midikorg

This is the shell to an electron app being developed to control a MICROKORG synthesizer. 

## Getting started

Make sure `yarn`, `node`, and `electron` are installed on your machine.
Run `yarn install` to get all dependencies built. 
Run `yarn build` to bundle javascript for the app.
Run `electron .` and the electron app should open in a window. 

### Reloading code

`yarn run watch` in a separate process will watch and recompile your js. Refresh the electron app with CMD+R and the new javascript will be loaded.
